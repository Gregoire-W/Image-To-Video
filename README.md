## 🖼️ Example  
#### 🐈 Let's start with a cat and a simple prompt:  
"It's a cat, make it move"    
<img src="./imgs/chat.jpeg" alt="alt text" width="430" height=285 />  
<img src="./imgs/generation_chat.gif" alt="alt text" width="300" height=500 />  

---

#### 🐕 Now with the dog and no prompt
<img src="./imgs/chien.jpeg" alt="alt text" width="320" height=450 />     
<img src="./imgs/generation_chat.gif" alt="alt text" width="300" height=500 />
